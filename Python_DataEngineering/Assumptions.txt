Assumptions-
------------------
1.There are no faulty bikes.
2.Key="Nbbikes" represents the no of bikes available without considering the no of locked bikes,and key="commonName" ,
represents the bikepoint.
3.If users fetch from database using query_from_users method,I have considered time to be input in the format represented 
in API.

DDL query statements
----------------------
1.create database base;
2.use base;
3.create table bikes_available1 (dock_point varchar(100),no_of_bikes numeric,timestamp varchar(100),date varchar(50))
4.create table timestamps_table1(timestamp varchar(20),nof_of_bikes numeric,dock_point varchar(100),date varchar(50))
5.insert into bikes_available1 values(%s,%s,%s,%s)
6.insert into timestamps_table1 values(%s,%s,%s,%s)
7.select no_of_bikes from bikes_available1 where dock_point=%s and timestamp=%s and date=%s
8.select nof_of_bikes,dock_point from timestamps_table1 where timestamp= %s and date=%s

In this assignement we have used Scheduler package which will work as cron job and execute our Extract, Store and Fetch 
method every 5 minutes.


Note:
-------------------
We have added extra functionality which is called query_from_users. 
1.This function takes input as the bikepoint name provided by the user and the time at which the user try to check the
avilable bikes. It then return the total number of available bikes present in that bikepoint at that point of time.
2.It also takes input ,time stamp and returns no of bikes available ,in all dock points accross London at that 
particular time stamp.
